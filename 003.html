						<h3>Lyrics</h3>
						<p>
							He's got the whole world<br>
							In his hands he's got the whole wide world<br>
							In his hands he's got the whole wide world<br>
							In his hands he's got the whole world in his hands<br><br>
							He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got
							the little bitty baby in his hands<br>
							He's got the little bitty baby in his hands he's got
							the whole world in his hands<br><br>
							He's got the whole world in his hands...<br><br>
							He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got<br>
							you and me sister in his hands<br>
							He's got you and me brother in his hands he's got<br>
							the whole world in his hands<br><br>
							He's got the whole world in his hands...<br><br>
							He's got everybody here in his hands he's got<br>
							everybody here in his hands<br>
							He's got everybody here in his hands he's got the<br>
							whole world in his hands
